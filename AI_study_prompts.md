## üìò Flashcard-Style Practice (Knowledge Recall + Reinforcement + Source After Answer)

```
I am preparing for the CompTIA Data+ certification exam. I want to practice in flashcard-style format. Generate one multiple-choice question at a time across mixed domains such as data quality, statistics, governance, visualization, ETL, and reporting.  Remind me to upload the index from my Data+ study guide if I didn't do that or if its no longer in the session cache.

IMPORTANT RULES:

- Do NOT provide any hints or references before I answer.
- After I answer, tell me:

1. Whether I was correct or incorrect.
2. A brief reinforcement explanation.
3. Reinforce with one extra relevant fact.
4. THEN reveal the source concept or reference category (e.g., ‚ÄúData Quality ‚Üí Validity vs Accuracy‚Äù or ‚ÄúStatistics ‚Üí Measures of Central Tendency‚Äù) ‚Äî but ONLY after I answer.

Wait for my input before showing the next question. Stop after 5 unless I say ‚Äúcontinue.‚Äù

## üü¶ Tier 1 ‚Äì Warmup / Foundational MCQs

```
Generate Tier 1 difficulty CompTIA Data+ multiple-choice questions. These should be straightforward concept or vocabulary-based, across mixed domains (data quality dimensions, data types, visualizations, file formats, report types, etc.).

Do NOT provide any hints. After I answer, tell me correct or incorrect, give a one-sentence explanation, and reinforce with one extra relevant fact. Wait for me to say ‚Äúnext‚Äù before giving the next question. Stop after 5.
```

## üüß Tier 2 ‚Äì Harder Questions with Plausible Distractors

```
I want to practice Tier 2 difficulty CompTIA Data+ questions. Generate one scenario-based multiple-choice question at a time with subtle distractors ‚Äî meaning more than one answer may sound reasonable, but only ONE is the MOST correct.

Do not provide references before I answer. After I answer, tell me:

1. Correct or incorrect
2. A concise explanation of why
3. A reinforcement summary (e.g., key comparison table or rule of thumb)
4. Optionally mention the knowledge domain (e.g., ‚ÄúData Governance / Access Control Models‚Äù)

Wait for me to say ‚Äúnext‚Äù before continuing. Stop after 5 unless I request more.
```

## üî¥ Tier 3 ‚Äì Full Simulation / Case-Style Questions

```
Give me Tier 3 difficulty CompTIA Data+ questions. These should be full scenario or simulation-style questions that require multi-step reasoning, interpretation of trends, or balancing governance vs usability.

Make the answer choices closely competing ‚Äî all should sound plausible, but only ONE should be the best strategic or technically accurate answer.

After I answer:

1. Tell me whether I was correct or incorrect.
2. Provide a full breakdown of the logic behind the right answer.
3. Reinforce the takeaway with a brief insight rule (e.g. ‚ÄúWhen presenting to executives, aggregated clarity beats granular detail‚Äù).
4. Mention which Data+ domain this tests.

Do not reveal hints before I answer. Wait for me to say ‚Äúnext‚Äù after each question. Stop after 3‚Äì5 unless I say continue.
```

## üîÄ Mixed Exam Mode (Tier 1‚Äì3 Blend)

```
Simulate a CompTIA Data+ mini exam. Give me 10 mixed questions ranging across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 difficulty. Vary the domains: data governance, ETL, statistics, report delivery, visualization, SQL logic, etc.

Do not tell me the answers until AFTER I answer each one. After each response, tell me if I‚Äôm correct or incorrect and give a short reinforcement point. Track my score as we go. After all 10, provide an overall evaluation: strongest and weakest categories.
